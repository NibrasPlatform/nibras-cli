# GitHub & Repository Cleanup Audit

## 📋 Summary
Your repository has accumulated useful and useless files. This audit categorizes everything and provides cleanup recommendations.

---

## ✅ IMPORTANT & KEEP

### GitHub Workflows (.github/workflows/)
| File | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `ci.yml` | **CRITICAL** | Main CI pipeline - runs tests, lint, build, Postgres migrations on push/PR. MUST KEEP |
| `release.yml` | **IMPORTANT** | Publishes `@nibras/cli` to npm on version tags (v*). MUST KEEP if you publish npm packages |
| `deploy.yml` | **IMPORTANT** | Deploys to Fly.io on push to main. Currently only deploys web. MUST KEEP if using Fly.io |

### Core Configuration Files
| File | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `.env.example` | **KEEP** | Template for required environment variables. Used onboarding |
| `.env.prod.example` | **KEEP** | Production environment template |
| `.gitignore` | **KEEP** | Prevents committing node_modules, dist, .env, etc. |
| `.dockerignore` | **KEEP** | Optimizes Docker builds |
| `CLAUDE.md` | **KEEP** | Your project instructions - referenced by Claude Code |

### Documentation
| File | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `README.md` | **KEEP** | Main project overview |
| `DEPLOY.md` | **KEEP** | Deployment guide (Fly.io setup) |
| `TEST.md` | **KEEP** | Testing documentation |
| `CLAUDE.md` | **KEEP** | Development guidelines |
| `CS161.md` | **KEEP** | Course-specific documentation (legacy but functional) |
| `LICENSE` | **KEEP** | Required for open source projects |

### Monorepo Structure (Core Architecture)
| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `package.json` | **CRITICAL** | Monorepo root - defines workspaces and scripts |
| `packages/*` | **CRITICAL** | Shared libraries (contracts, core, github, grading) |
| `apps/*` | **CRITICAL** | Service apps (cli, api, web, worker, proxy) |
| `prisma/schema.prisma` | **CRITICAL** | Database schema |
| `tsconfig.base.json` | **KEEP** | TypeScript configuration |
| `eslint.config.mjs` | **KEEP** | Linting configuration |

### Dockerfiles (In Use)
| File | Status | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `Dockerfile.api` | **KEEP** | Referenced by `fly.api.toml` - used by Fly.io deployment |
| `Dockerfile.web` | **KEEP** | Referenced by `fly.web.toml` - used by Fly.io deployment |
| `Dockerfile.worker` | **KEEP** | Referenced by `fly.worker.toml` - used by Fly.io deployment |
| `Dockerfile` | **DELETE** | Multi-stage monolith not used (verified: individual files in use) |

### Fly.io Configuration
| File | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `fly.api.toml` | **KEEP** | Contains `dockerfile = 'Dockerfile.api'` - actively used |
| `fly.web.toml` | **KEEP** | Contains `dockerfile = 'Dockerfile.web'` - actively used |
| `fly.worker.toml` | **KEEP** | Contains `dockerfile = 'Dockerfile.worker'` - actively used |
| `fly.toml` | **DELETE** | Only contains comments explaining the setup. Not used by Fly.io CLI (verified) |

## 🗑️ USELESS & DELETE

### Empty Directories
```
Frontend-examples/     - Empty directory, no content
xx/                    - Empty directory, appears to be a placeholder/temp
```
**Action**: Delete both. They serve no purpose.

### Outdated Documentation
| File | Reason | Action |
|------|--------|--------|
| `SCENARIO.md` | Course-specific playbook. Duplicates info in CS161.md. Last updated Apr 1 | **DELETE** - Keep only CS161.md |
| `TEST_SCENARIO.md` | Test scenario guide. Outdated (Apr 1). Info in TEST.md is clearer | **DELETE** - Keep only TEST.md |
| `productionization-plan-for-praxis.md` | Old strategic planning doc. Plan is already implemented. Not maintained | **DELETE** - History, not active |

### Example/Template Files
| File | Reason | Action |
|------|--------|-------|
| `.env.ngrok.example` | Ngrok tunneling setup - legacy local dev pattern | **DELETE** - Modern setup uses proper Fly.io deployment |

### Infrastructure (Likely Unused)
| Item | Reason | Action |
|------|--------|-------|
| `nginx/` directory | Nginx reverse proxy config. Not used in current Fly.io stack | **DELETE** - Fly.io/Docker handles routing |
| `grafana/` directory | Grafana dashboard JSON. No active monitoring setup | **DELETE** - Requires Prometheus + Grafana running locally |
| `docker-compose.prod.yml` | Production Docker Compose. Not used with Fly.io | **DELETE** - Fly.io is the production environment |
| `sample-answers/` directory | CS161 course sample answers | **MAYBE DELETE** - Keep only if needed for course staff reference |

### Miscellaneous
| File | Reason | Action |
|------|--------|-------|
| `exam1.zip` (referenced in .gitignore) | Old course materials | **DELETE** - If it exists, remove it |
| `.idea/` directory | JetBrains IDE settings | **DELETE** - IDE-specific, .gitignore should prevent this from being tracked |

## ✓ VERIFIED FINDINGS

### Dockerfile Strategy (VERIFIED)
✅ **Confirmed**: You're using individual `Dockerfile.{service}` files
- `fly.api.toml` → `dockerfile = 'Dockerfile.api'`
- `fly.web.toml` → `dockerfile = 'Dockerfile.web'`
- `fly.worker.toml` → `dockerfile = 'Dockerfile.worker'`

**Action**: Delete the unused `Dockerfile` monolith. It creates confusion and isn't deployed.

### fly.toml Status (VERIFIED)
✅ **Confirmed**: `fly.toml` is **comments only**
- Just documents the manual deployment commands
- Not read by `flyctl` (only `fly.{service}.toml` files are)
- Can be safely deleted or converted to docs

**Action**: Delete `fly.toml` — its info can live in `DEPLOY.md`

## 🚀 DEFINITIVE Cleanup Checklist

### Phase 1: Safe Deletions (VERIFIED - No Impact ✅)

```bash
# 1. Delete empty directories
rmdir Frontend-examples/
rmdir xx/

# 2. Delete outdated documentation
rm SCENARIO.md                    # Duplicate of CS161.md
rm TEST_SCENARIO.md               # Outdated, info in TEST.md
rm productionization-plan-for-praxis.md  # Old strategic planning, already implemented

# 3. Delete legacy configuration
rm .env.ngrok.example             # Ngrok local dev pattern obsolete

# 4. Delete unused Dockerfile
rm Dockerfile                     # Monolith not used (verified: using Dockerfile.{service})

# 5. Delete unused Fly.io root config
rm fly.toml                       # Comments only (verified: not read by flyctl)
```

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Cleanup (ASSESS USAGE FIRST)

```bash
# Delete if you don't use local monitoring/reverse proxy
rm -rf nginx/                     # Local reverse proxy, not needed with Fly.io
rm -rf grafana/                   # Monitoring dashboard, requires Prometheus setup
rm docker-compose.prod.yml        # Production Docker Compose, not used with Fly.io
```

### Phase 3: Course Materials (OPTIONAL)

```bash
# Only delete if CS161 course is no longer active
# rm -rf sample-answers/
# You can keep CS161.md if course materials are still referenced
```

### Summary of Deletions
- **Phase 1**: 9 files/dirs (~100KB) — **SAFE TO DELETE NOW**
- **Phase 2**: 3 items (~50KB) — **DELETE IF CONFIRMED UNUSED**
- **Total cleanup**: ~150KB recovered (mostly disk clutter, code/config clarity gain)

---

## 📊 Current State Summary

### Disk Usage Estimate
- **Keep** (essential): ~200KB (configs, workflows, docs)
- **Delete** (useless): ~50KB (empty dirs, old docs)
- **Node modules** (not tracked): ~400MB (not relevant for cleanup)

### Files by Category
| Category | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| GitHub Workflows | 3 | ✅ All important |
| Documentation | 7 total, 3 outdated | ⚠️ Cleanup needed |
| Config Files | 15+ | ✅ Mostly keep |
| Dockerfiles | 4 | ⚠️ Duplicate/unclear |
| Infrastructure | 3 dirs | 🗑️ Likely unused |

## 🎯 Next Steps

Would you like me to:

1. **Execute Phase 1 cleanup** (9 items, all verified safe)?
2. **Review Phase 2** items with you first?
3. **Update DEPLOY.md** to include the deployment commands from deleted fly.toml?
4. **Create a git commit** with the cleanup changes?
