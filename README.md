# Nibras CLI — πρᾶξις

`nibras` is a course operations CLI and hosted validation stack for project
setup, testing, submission, and tracked verification.

This repo includes:

- the legacy course CLI under `src/`
- the hosted CLI under `apps/cli/`
- a Fastify API under `apps/api/`
- a Next.js dashboard under `apps/web/`
- a verification worker under `apps/worker/`
- a local same-origin proxy under `apps/proxy/`
- shared contracts and helpers under `packages/`

For the canonical manual validation path, use `TEST_SCENARIO.md`.

## At A Glance

The active product surface is the `apps/` and `packages/` monorepo. The `src/`
directory is the legacy CLI and is kept for backwards compatibility.

Supported workflows include:

- project-local commands with `nibras test`, `nibras submit`, `nibras task`, and `nibras setup`
- device login with `nibras login`, `logout`, and `whoami`
- tracked submissions, verification status transitions, and admin overrides
- strict private grading, semantic grading, manual score fallback, and optional `check50`
- AI grading with confidence scores, criterion breakdowns, and reasoning summaries (optional, requires `NIBRAS_AI_API_KEY`)
- instructor dashboard: course management, project/milestone setup, submission review queue, grade CSV export
- GitHub OAuth, GitHub App install linking, signed webhook handling, and commit status checks on student repos
- transactional email notifications for students and instructors via Resend (optional, requires `RESEND_API_KEY`)

Project tracking docs:

- `docs/project-tracking.md`

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `>=18`
- npm
- git
- Docker for the Postgres-backed local stack
- unzip for `setup`
- wget or curl for HTTP(S) setup downloads
- check50 only if you use `check50` projects
- ngrok for live GitHub callback and webhook validation

## Install

The published CLI package:

```bash
npm install -g @nibras/cli
```

Or install from source (legacy CLI entry point):

```bash
npm ci
npm install -g .
```

## Build And Verification

Run the preflight gate before manual testing:

```bash
npm run manual:preflight
```

This runs:

- `npm test`
- `npm run web:build`

## Local Dev Summary

For the base local stack, GitHub App variables are optional. You only need them
for live OAuth and webhook validation.

Primary local run path:

```bash
npm ci
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

`npm run dev` will:

- require `.env`
- start the local Postgres container with Docker Compose
- wait for Postgres readiness
- run `npx prisma migrate deploy`
- build the TypeScript services once
- start TypeScript watch mode plus the API, worker, and web dev servers

Expected local endpoints:

- API health: `http://127.0.0.1:4848/v1/health`
- Web app: `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
- Worker health: `http://127.0.0.1:9090/healthz`

When `DATABASE_URL` is set, the API uses Prisma/Postgres instead of the
file-backed dev store. The Prisma schema lives in `prisma/schema.prisma`.

`npm run db:push` is still available for disposable development, but it is not
the canonical acceptance path.

For the full step-by-step manual validation sequence, use `TEST_SCENARIO.md`.

## Destructive Maintenance

To reset the local Postgres volume from scratch:

```bash
npm run db:local:reset
npm run db:local:migrate
```

`db:local:reset` removes the Docker volume. It is opt-in maintenance, not part
of the default `npm run dev` flow.

## GitHub App Summary

For live GitHub validation, use `.env.ngrok.example`, start the same local
stack, then also run:

```bash
npm run proxy:dev
ngrok http 8080
```

The proxy fans requests out like this:

- `/v1/*` and `/dev/*` -> local API `http://127.0.0.1:4848`
- everything else -> local web app `http://127.0.0.1:3000`

Use the public ngrok URL in:

- `NIBRAS_API_BASE_URL`
- `NIBRAS_WEB_BASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_NIBRAS_API_BASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_NIBRAS_WEB_BASE_URL`

GitHub cannot call `127.0.0.1`, so the public tunnel URL must also be used in
the GitHub App settings.

For the full live end-to-end validation flow, use `TEST_SCENARIO.md`.

### GitHub App Checklist

1. Create the app under your personal account or the owning organization.
   GitHub Docs: https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/registering-a-github-app

2. Fill the core registration fields.
   `GitHub App name`: short, unique, <= 34 chars.
   `Homepage URL`: `<public-url>/`
   `Callback URL`: `<public-url>/v1/github/oauth/callback`
   `Setup URL`: `<public-url>/install/complete`
   `Webhook URL`: `<public-url>/v1/github/webhooks`
   `Webhook secret`: generate a random secret and put it in `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

3. Enable the auth modes this repo uses.
   Enable `Device Flow`.
   Keep `Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation` disabled.
   Keep expiring user tokens enabled.
   Callback URL docs: https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/registering-a-github-app/about-the-user-authorization-callback-url

4. Set the minimum permissions.
   Repository permissions:
   `Contents`: Read and write
   `Metadata`: Read-only
   `Commit statuses`: Read and write

5. Subscribe to the events the backend handles.
   Enable `Push`.

6. Choose installation scope.
   For private testing, choose `Only on this account`.

7. Generate credentials and store them in `.env`.
   Copy the App ID, Client ID, Client Secret, App name, and private key into `.env`.
   Put the private key into `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` with literal newlines or escaped `\n`.

8. If you want automatic repo provisioning from a template, configure:
   `GITHUB_TEMPLATE_OWNER`
   `GITHUB_TEMPLATE_REPO`

9. Update the GitHub App settings whenever your tunnel URL changes.
   If your ngrok URL rotates, update the homepage, callback, setup, and webhook URLs and then restart the local services.

10. Verify webhook signing.
    This repo validates `X-Hub-Signature-256` using `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

## Email Notifications

When `RESEND_API_KEY` is set, the system sends transactional emails via [Resend](https://resend.com).

Emails sent automatically:

| Trigger                                              | Recipient                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Submission verified (passed / failed / needs review) | Student                        |
| Submission flagged for human review                  | All course instructors and TAs |
| Instructor submits a review                          | Student                        |

Relevant env vars:

- `RESEND_API_KEY` — get a free key at resend.com
- `NIBRAS_EMAIL_FROM` — sender address, must be a verified domain in your Resend account (e.g. `Nibras <noreply@yourdomain.com>`)

Omit `RESEND_API_KEY` to disable email entirely with no other changes required.

## Commit Status Checks

After every submission is verified, the worker posts a GitHub commit status to
the student's repo. Students see a ✅, ❌, or 🔄 badge directly on their commit
and can click through to their Nibras submission page.

| Nibras status  | GitHub badge | Label                                     |
| -------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `passed`       | ✅ green     | All tests passed                          |
| `failed`       | ❌ red       | Tests failed                              |
| `needs_review` | 🔄 pending   | Tests passed — awaiting instructor review |

Requires the GitHub App to have **Commit statuses: Read and write** permission
(see GitHub App Checklist) and the student to have completed the app installation
flow so their `installationId` is recorded. If either is missing the check is
skipped silently.

`NIBRAS_WEB_BASE_URL` must be set for the status badge to link back to the
submission page.

## Grade Export

Instructors can download a CSV of all grades for a course:

```
GET /v1/tracking/courses/:courseId/grades.csv
```

The CSV contains one row per student with columns for each milestone across all
projects in the course. Cell values are the review score when one exists, or the
submission status otherwise.

## AI Grading

When `NIBRAS_AI_API_KEY` and `NIBRAS_AI_MODEL` are set, the worker
automatically grades semantic questions after a successful verification run.
Results pre-fill the instructor review form with confidence scores, criterion
breakdowns, reasoning summaries, and evidence quotes.

Relevant env vars (see `.env.example` for defaults):

- `NIBRAS_AI_API_KEY` — required to enable AI grading
- `NIBRAS_AI_MODEL` — model name (default: `gpt-4o-mini`)
- `NIBRAS_AI_BASE_URL` — override for Azure, Ollama, or other OpenAI-compatible providers
- `NIBRAS_AI_MIN_CONFIDENCE` — submissions below this threshold are flagged for human review (default: `0.8`)

Omit `NIBRAS_AI_API_KEY` to disable AI grading entirely with no other changes required.
